Project: Smart Order Management System (SOMS)
Concept
The SOMS application is a distributed system for managing product orders in an e-commerce setup. It demonstrates how services can collaborate using Eureka for service discovery, gRPC for inter-service communication, and Kafka for event-driven processing.

Services Overview
User Service

Responsibility: Manage user profiles and authentication.
Communication: Provides user details to the Order Service via gRPC.
Example API:
getUserDetails(userId): User (gRPC)
Product Service

Responsibility: Manage product inventory and pricing.
Communication: Exposes APIs to fetch product details via gRPC.
Example API:
getProductDetails(productId): Product (gRPC)
updateStock(productId, quantity) (gRPC)
Order Service

Responsibility: Handles order placement and updates.
Communication:
Uses gRPC to fetch user and product details from the respective services.
Publishes order-related events (e.g., "Order Created", "Order Processed") to Kafka.
Example Flow:
A new order is created, and the Order Service verifies user and product details.
Once verified, an event is published to Kafka for further processing.
Notification Service

Responsibility: Sends notifications (e.g., email or SMS) for order updates.
Communication:
Subscribes to Kafka topics like OrderCreated and OrderProcessed.
Example Flow:
Listens to OrderCreated topic and sends an email confirmation to the user.
Analytics Service

Responsibility: Generates insights based on order data.
Communication:
Consumes Kafka topics for order events to track sales trends and stock insights.
Architecture
Service Discovery:
All services are registered with Eureka Server for dynamic discovery. Services can locate each other via Eureka, making the system resilient to scaling and service restarts.

Communication:

gRPC: Used for synchronous, efficient communication between services like Order Service, User Service, and Product Service.
Kafka: Handles asynchronous communication for event-driven updates (e.g., publishing order events, consuming them for notifications and analytics).
Tech Stack
Backend:
Java with Spring Boot for gRPC services and Eureka integration.
Kafka for messaging.
Database:
PostgreSQL/MySQL for relational data.
Service Discovery:
Eureka Server.
Messaging:
Kafka for event streaming.
How to Structure
Create Eureka Server

Run a Eureka Server for service registration.
Develop Services

User Service: Implements gRPC endpoints to manage users.
Product Service: Provides product details and stock updates via gRPC.
Order Service: Acts as the central orchestrator for placing orders.
Notification Service and Analytics Service: Kafka consumers for processing events.
Integrate Kafka

Define topics for order-related events like OrderCreated, OrderProcessed.
Use Kafka Producer API for event publishing.
Use Kafka Consumer API for processing events.
